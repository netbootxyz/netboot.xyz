# Booting from ISO

### Burning a CD/DVD
To create a bootable CD-ROM/DVD, burn the ISO image [netboot.xyz.iso](https://boot.netboot.xyz/ipxe/netboot.xyz.iso) to a blank CD-ROM/DVD.  Insert the media into the server, set the proper boot order and boot up.

### Virtual Machine Software
You can also use these ISOs to boot any sort of VM in Citrix XenServer, VMware ESXi, VMware Fusion, VirtualBox. 

### Out of Band Virtual Media
They are great for attaching to remote virtual media of a server like the Dell DRAC or HP iLOs.  Because the iPXE boot disk is so light weight, they are great for starting installations where there might be really low bandwidth.
